## Notes

Control Tower is the composition of many AWS services

* [AWS SSO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/singlesignon/index.html) - integrated with Microsoft AD on-prem and cloud/azure
* [Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/organizations/index.html)
    * [Service Control Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scp.html) - central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your organization, allowing you to ensure your accounts stay within your organizationâ€™s access control guidelines
* Guardrails - two kinds of guardrails exist: preventive (block) and detective (after the fact notification of non-compliance)
    * implemented as [AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/config/index.html) - monitor for compliance
* [Service Catalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/) - self-service provisioning of cloud products
* [AWS landing zone](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/aws-landing-zone/) is a solution that helps customers more quickly set up a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices.
